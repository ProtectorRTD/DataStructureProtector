## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

- `src:`: The folder with implementation Data structure
  - `main:` 
    - `java:`

      - `binary_tree:` The folder where my Binary Tree implementation is located. 
  - `test:`
    - `java:` The folder with test
