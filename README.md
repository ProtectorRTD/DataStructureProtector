## Data Structure By Protector RTD


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

- `src:`: The folder with implementation Data structure
  - `LinkedList:` The folder where my Linked List implementation is located. Also in the folder there will be tests that can be viewed and run
